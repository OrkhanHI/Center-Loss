### About the Project
Given 30000 food images from 59 classes I have performed image classification task. Due to confidentiality I am unable to upload data here.
The goal of the project is improve the performance by introducing the strategy to capture high intra-class variance and low inter-class variance.
There are a lot of algorithms that can be utilised such Center Loss (*A Discriminative Feature Learning Approach for Deep Face Recognition* - https://ydwen.github.io/papers/WenECCV16.pdf), 
Large-margin Gaussian Mixture Loss [LGM-Loss] (*Rethinking Feature Distribution for Loss Functions in Image Classification* - http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Wan_Rethinking_Feature_Distribution_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf),etc.
